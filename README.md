Hello. I study computer engineering (and science) in METU (Middle East Technical University), Turkey. I recently took a variety of courses such as operational research, embedded systems development, signals and systems (like Fourier transforms etc....) and currently involved in a research project in computer networks.

My main interest is R&D of autonomous systems control.
